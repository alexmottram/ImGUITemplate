# ImGUITemplate
Template for projects using ImGUI to help get started quickly.

Overview:
- The original setup is to create apps using Win32 and DirectX12 in imgui.
- This is meant to work with MinGW64 using CMake but will also work with Visual Studios Compiler.
- If using MinGW64 you will need a WindowsSDK to get DirectX12 and there is a fix required to the master or docking versions of imgui.
